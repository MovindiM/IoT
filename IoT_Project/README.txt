This is a group project submitted to EN3251 - Internet of Things @ENTC - University of Moratuwa.

Task 1:
To develop an MQTT Publisher using a Python script. The script will publish a set of virtual sensor information to an MQTT Broker. The set of sensors will represent a real Manufacturing IoT environment. 

Environment 			Sensors 
Manufacturing Environment	CO2 Sensors
				Smoke Sensors
				Pressure sensor
				Occupancy Detectors
				Production counting data
				Level sensors (Liquid)
				Generator Fuel capacity

Task 2:
To obtain data pertaining to a given IoT environment from the MQTT Broker, (different from the one created by the group) and design and develop a NodeRED dashboard to visualize the data in the most effective manner.
