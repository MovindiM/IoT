# IoT Project - Manufacturing Environment Monitoring

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a group project submitted to EN3251 - Internet of Things at the University of Moratuwa. The project involves the development of an MQTT Publisher in Python to simulate a Manufacturing IoT environment and the creation of a NodeRED dashboard to visualize data from a different MQTT Broker.

## Task 1: MQTT Publisher (Python Script)

### Environment and Sensors

- Manufacturing Environment
  - CO2 Sensors
  - Smoke Sensors
  - Pressure Sensor
  - Occupancy Detectors
  - Production Counting Data
  - Level Sensors (Liquid)
  - Generator Fuel Capacity

## Task 2:
To obtain data pertaining to a given IoT environment from the MQTT Broker, (different from the one created by the group) and design and develop a NodeRED dashboard to visualize the data in the most effective manner.
